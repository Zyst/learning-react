# Learning React
A repository where I drop code I create as I learn React, currently working on [Hacking with React](http://www.hackingwithreact.com).

## Hacking with React

The [Hacking with React](http://www.hackingwithreact.com) code is located in: `hacking-with-react/hwr` and it can be run with:

```bash
webpack-dev-server
```

Currently reading: [Lesson 31/42](http://www.hackingwithreact.com/read/1/31/the-first-80-is-done-now-what).
